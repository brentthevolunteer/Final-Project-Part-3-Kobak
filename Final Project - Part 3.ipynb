    "**Building Characteristics**\n",
    "Catalogues several characteristics of all buildings, such as year built, square footage, etc. Why: Some building characteristics may impact the risk of a fire in the future. For example, older buildings may contain knob-and-tube electrical wiring, which is less safe than modern electrical wiring.\n",
